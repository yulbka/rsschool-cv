### Summary  
I want to change my professional sphere. I work at bank as economist, but I realize, that this isn't my calling. I became interested in computer  programming at summer. I decided to learn javascript because it's very common, has syntax that is similar to English language and has wide range of use. And it is very exciting to create something using lines of code. So, I try to explore new material every day. My near-term goal is to complete "Java-script/Front-end" course. Then I hope to find a job at it-company as javascript developer and advance my skills further.
